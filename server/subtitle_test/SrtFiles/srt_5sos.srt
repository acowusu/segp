1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
One, two, three.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hello

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I promise you, I'm to the end of time

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'll house and fight with a man

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We dance inside your hood

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And if you leave me in the morning

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'll have such a such a lonely heart

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh I

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Such a lovely fly

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If you can fight another reason to stay

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Then I know I'm gonna always have a lonely lonely lonely lonely

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Your precious heart can't watch it break

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So I close my eyes while you walk away

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Can I have a second chance?

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Can I have another dance?

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Can I start another life with you?

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah, when I wake up in a haze

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And I have a second day's

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
A thousand miles away

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
With such a lonely heart

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, oh, oh

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
With such a lonely heart

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh, oh, oh

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
If you can find another reason to stay

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Then I know I'm gonna always have a lonely, lonely, lonely

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Oh, oh, oh

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Lonely, if it is nothing new, nothing new to me

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Nothing new to me

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Nothing new, nothing new to you

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Lonely, if it is nothing new, nothing new to me

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Nothing new to me

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Nothing new to me

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Nothing new to you

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Mm, oh, oh

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Start your lonely life

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh, oh, oh

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
If you can find another reason to stay

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Then I know I'm gonna always have it lonely, lonely, lonely

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The sun was setting behind the distant mountains,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
casting a warm glow over the tranquil valley below.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Birds chirp softly in the trees, and a gentle breeze rust-tilted the leaves.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
As the evening descended, the sky turned into a canvass of vibrant colors,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
painting the horizon with shades of orange, pink and purple.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It was a peaceful scene, a moment of serenity amidst the chaos of the world.
