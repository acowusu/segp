const DEFAULT_USER  = "```Public Holidays: Equatorial Guinea’s Vice President Insists Superyacht in Italian Vacation Hotspots is a Military VesselNovember 2, 2023Equatorial GuineaShip TrackingEquatorial Guinea’s Vice President says that the luxury yacht Blue Shadow belongs to the African country’s Ministry of Defence. Why, then, has it spent the last few months travelling to swanky vacation destinations in the Mediterranean? Using open source vessel tracking data, along with satellite imagery and publicly available social media posts, Bellingcat has located Blue Shadow — and a second superyacht reportedly owned by the Equatorial Guinean government — at various ports and anchorages in Portugal and Italy since June 2023.Flight tracking data also show that an Equatorial Guinean government aircraft and a private jet frequently used by Teodoro Nguema Obiang, the country’s vice president since 2016, made multiple trips to and from airports in Italy in close proximity to Blue Shadow from September 11 to October 3, 2023.In one instance, the private jet flew to Sardinia, where the superyachts Blue Shadow and Ice had already arrived. Five days later, the plane departed for Milan, where posts on his Instagram account show that Obiang, who is nicknamed Teodorín, attended a runway show at Milan Fashion Week. Afterwards, he headed to this year’s UN General Assembly in New York.```"
